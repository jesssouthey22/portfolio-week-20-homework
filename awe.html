            <br>
            <p>The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Water (AWE), is a newly established department as of 2020 that was previously two departments; 
                 <li>The Department of Agriculture (www.agriculture.gov.au)</li>
                 <li>The Department of Environment and Energy (www. environment.gov.au) </li>
                 <br>
                 The website is currently being updated to reflect the merge of these two websites (www. environment.gov.au and www.agriculture.gov.au) on www.awe.gov.au. For the purposes of this Case Study, we aimed to continue the synthesis of both these websites into a modern and more user-centered website.</p>

        <h4 class="casestudysubhead">The Challenge</h4><br>

    <p>AWE aims to protect Australiaâ€™s natural resources, help develop strong agricultural industries, manage land and heritage, and conduct research to benefit Australian communities and assist governement and industry. Formerly known as two seperate bodies, the Department of Agriculture, The Department of Environment and Energy, AWE serves as an amalgum of these following their recent merge in January 2020.

    Our biggest challenge to begin with was determining what the AWE website was trying to achieve. With three currently functioning websites, the information and objectives were scattered and the AWE website to merge the information remained incomplete. We quickly realised most links from this website linked back to the agriculture and environment websites with no clear way back or indicator that you were leaving the site. 
    </p>
    </div>



    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h4 class="casestudysubhead">The Problem</h4><br>

    <p>The AWE websiteâ€™s, outdated, cold and clinical design, married with the challenges of a large interdepartmental merger leaves users faced with navigating insurmountable volumes of content with much of the information contained within external sites. These factors in unison deliver an inconsistent, confusing and unfriendly experience.</p></div>

<div class="col-md-6"></div>

    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h4 class="casestudysubhead">The Solution</h4><br>

    <p>We aimed to create a redesign that was clean, modern and functional that prioritized users ability to navigate between major topics overseen by the Department. We determined hierarchies based on our anticipation of what users would interact with the most and what information was high priority for AWE to share. We created a more positive experience overall by enhancing opportunities for consistency, recognition and flexibility of use.</p></div>

<h3 class="casestudyheadings">User Research</h3>  <br>

<div><h4 class="casestudysubhead">Proto-Persona</h4><br>
<p>We began by creating a proto-persona, here we started to ideate and empathise to invisiage a typical user-group of AWE. Christine, a Journalist, would visit AWE seeking information for a story sheâ€™s working on. While identifying one of our main user groups as Media personnel, we kept a keen focus on the needs of the general public experiencing AWE and improving their relationship with the Department.</p>

</div>

<div><h4 class="casestudysubhead">Heuristic Evaluation and Redlining</h4><br>
<p>To better understand the existing AWE website we set out on conducting a heuristic evaluation. Here we combed through the site annotating and redlining key information spanning content, functionality, user feedback and neuances within the sites interactivity. Some of our key findings inculeded inconsistencies in text font, link styles and card sizes, as well as use of jargon and poor navigation structure, all of which were negatively impacting users</p>
</div><br><br>
<div>
<div id="empathise">
    <h6>EMPATHISE</h6>
<h4 class="casestudysubhead">User Testing & Affinity Diagram</h4><br>
<p>We undertook the conducting of 5 remote Usibility Tests over Zoom on the Desktop and 5 additional tests on the Mobile version of awe.gov.au, asking participants to find their way through a series of three tasks related to navigation and finding documentation throughout sections of the existing AWE website. We collated our results into an Affinity Diagram to identify common responses and pain points in order to decide which elements to prioritize in our redesign.</p>

<h4 class="casestudysubhead">2x2 Matrix</h4><br>
<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-4"><p>We used a 2x2 Matrix to prioritize our feedback based on high priority for the user and high priority for AWE</p><br><p>We found that our users were having the most difficulty navigating the current site because of the multitude of links to the external sites, link heavy content pages, no ability to filter articles. We decided it was high priority for both users and AWE that navigation was as simple as possible, that the purpose of the site and who it was intended for was clearer, improving the overall look and feel of the site and reduce the amount of unnecessary information.</p></div>

We determined that each major category should have itâ€™s own section in the navigation, with a comprehensive drop down list for each, to reduce the amount of in-page subnavigation and make lists that are easy to scan.</p>

<div class="col-md-4"><p>After testing our wireframes we performed 5 Second tests on our homepage after the style guide was applied, 7 Remote User Test were completed with our clickable mobile hi-fidelity prototype.

    We got many valuable insights and positive feedback on the clarity of the presentation, almost all users said the mobile version was professional and neat and the heirarchy was understandable and intuitive. The bulk of our feedback was to do with phrasing, recognition of acronyms and keeping the buzzwords at the beginning of lists. We were able to apply these to our final iterations on both mobile and desktop.</p></div>

    We appreciated the positive changes we saw in our users interaction with our prototype, the ease of use of our navigation systems, their ability to recogonise where they were on the site at all times. In our final test plan, we decided to retest the aspect our users found most difficult from the AWE tests; finding Communiques. We were pleased to see that many users were able to navigate to this section with ease, while there is still some question of the use of jargon for this section that we would like to test further with those working in the media industry.</p></div>

    <h6>CONCLUSION</h6>
    <h3 class="casestudyheadings">Future Scope</h3><br>

<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-6">
    <h4 class="casestudysubhead">Difficulties</h4><br>
    <p>The biggest challenge for this redesign was identifying and integrating the most important assets from all three websites into one cohesive experience and ensuring all webpages were intuitively sorted to provide the user with a seamless experience. Initially, the website design did not feel friendly to the layperson, and more geared towards industry or media professional with no real ease of navigation. 
<br><br>
        We attempted to bridge the gap so that every-day people would be able to experience the wesbite in a way that felt welcoming and enhances educational opportunities relating to environmental, water and agricultural impacts for the general population. While also keeping it useable and functional for those working alongside AWE in the public and private sectors.</p></div>

        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h4 class="casestudysubhead">Learnings</h4><br>
            <p>Our biggests lessons in this redesign were from managing a large amount of web-content and organising it in and intutive way while keeping it minimalistic. We were focused on reducing an overwhelming amount of links and externally linked pages between these websites, and integrating them into clean, readable and scannable pages. Ensuring the website allowed users the flexibility to find their way to navigate to certain areas with multiple paths to enhance ease of use and recognition. 
<br><br>
    From our user tests we learned that colour coding our sections that contained large amounts of information made the users place in the website easy to recognise, alphabetising long lists with buzzwords at the beginning made our content easier to scan, white space around sections reduced the overwhelming feeling on content heavy pages, using colour blocks to break up sections visually as well as spacers worked well for our users in determining where sections began and ended.</p></div>

    <div class="col-12">
        <h4 class="casestudysubhead">Future Development</h4><br>
        <p>There are many opportunities for future development we would like to explore:
            <ul><li>We would recommend testing the News and Media navigation and resources with journalists to ensure it is intuitive for their needs. </li>
            <li>Further pages and migration of information from agriculture.gov.au and environment.gov.au.</li>
            <li>Further test and determine the best indicator for the dropdown footer on mobile.</li>
            <li>Further develop site landing pages and content</li></ul></p>
